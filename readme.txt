== Description ==

Hi,
This slider accepts min 3 max 5 amounts 880x340px photos.
1 - As the first we are uploading the photos from media. Max 5, Min 3, the system sees last 5 photos.
2 - Wherever slider will be set, we are putting there <!--rs_slider--> and updating. After updating we are coming wherever we set the slider, so we will see the slider codes.
3 - To edit the text we are finding;
<div id="rs_akindil_galeri_2">
<div class="alt_yazi_genel" id="alt_yazi_1">Jungle 1</div>
<div class="alt_yazi_genel" id="alt_yazi_2">Jungle 2</div>
<div class="alt_yazi_genel" id="alt_yazi_3">Jungle 3</div>
<div class="alt_yazi_genel" id="alt_yazi_4">Jungle 4</div>
</div>
</div>
